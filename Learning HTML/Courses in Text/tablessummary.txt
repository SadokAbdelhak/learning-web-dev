This is a temporary summary for tables since I dont have my copybook with me :) :

-A table organizes data into rows and columns.
<table></table>--> the table container
<tr>-->A new table row.
<th>-->table header cell (bold, centered by default).
<td>-->table data cell (normal content).

Note: the table only takes the width that it needs unlike many other elements in html.

If you want a collon to take the place of two collons it's td colspan="2" , if you want a row to take the place of two it's <td rowspan="2">..</td>

You can have a title for the table by using <caption>

Note: you can have sections like regular code by using : <thea>(for the table head),<tbody> for the body of the table , <tfoot> for the footer of the table.

For semantics you can add a few thing such as , ID for every row heading (not necessary), but its better to add scope for every row and collomn heading , such as :

<th scope="row"> and <th scope="col">
