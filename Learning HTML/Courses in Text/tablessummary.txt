This is a temporary summary for tables since I dont have my copybook with me :) :

-A table organizes data into rows and columns.
<table></table>--> the table container
<tr>-->A new table row.
<th>-->table header cell (bold, centered by default).
<td>-->table data cell (normal content).

Note: the table only takes the width that it needs unlike many other elements in html.

If you want a collon to take the place of two collons it's td colspan="2" , if you want a row to take the place of two it's td=rowspan=2
